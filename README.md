# ExactpAdicsCommon

Common code for the [ExactpAdics](https://github.com/cjdoris/ExactpAdics) and [ExactpAdics2](https://github.com/cjdoris/ExactpAdics2) packages. These need to manually merge from this repository when changes are made. Set this up as a submodule once:

```
$ git submodule add /path/to/here.git common
```

and periodically merge as follows:

```
$ git submodule update --remote --merge
```
